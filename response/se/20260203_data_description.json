Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, United States, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.FanetteIsland_ROW2696648958_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.FanetteIsland_ROW2696648958_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Info","Title":"Emerald Bay and Fannette Island, Lake Tahoe, California, United States","Copyright":"© Bill Stevenson/Cavan Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"","Link":""},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260203_FanetteIsland\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Fannette+Island&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260203_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260203_FanetteIsland"},"Ssd":"20260203","Name":"FanetteIsland","Market":"ROW","Hash":"2696648958","FullDateString":"3 feb. 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Alpine marmots are among the most charismatic inhabitants of the central European mountains. They stand out for their social life and their ability to adapt to the harshest winters. They live in colonies that cooperate with each other and use sharp whistles to warn of predators.

They dig extensive underground tunnels where they take shelter and raise their young.
