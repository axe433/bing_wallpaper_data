Old Rock Day highlights the vast geological processes that have shaped our world since its earliest eras.

The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.OldRockArch_EN-CA5672779401_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.OldRockArch_EN-CA5672779401_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Rock legends","Title":"Turret Arch framed by North Window in Arches National Park, Utah, United States","Copyright":"© Jim Patterson/TANDEM Stills + Motion","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/39.319587,-109.759965/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-CA&od=2&shading=flat&pp=39.319587,-109.759965;S9;Turret Arch, Arches National Park, Utah, United States&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=Turret%20Arch%2C%20Moab%2C%20UT%2C%20United%20States&ss=ypid.YNFC28AB40F6C87C7E&mb=38.68762~-109.542017~38.680987~-109.527855&description=Moab%2C%20UT%2084532&cardbg=%23219AB6&dt=1763123400000&tt=Turret%20Arch&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253DTurret%252520Arch%25252C%252520Moab%25252C%252520UT%25252C%252520United%252520States%2526ss%253Dypid.YNFC28AB40F6C87C7E%2526mb%253D38.68762~-109.542017~38.680987~-109.527855%2526description%253DMoab%25252C%252520UT%25252084532%2526cardbg%253D%252523219AB6%2526dt%253D1763123400000&tstt0=Turret%20Arch&cp=38.431156~-117.651931&lvl=5.3719306&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260107_OldRockArch\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Arches+National+Park+Windows&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260107_0500\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260107_OldRockArch"},"Ssd":"20260107","Name":"OldRockArch","Market":"EN-CA","Hash":"5672779401","FullDateString":"Jan. 7, 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Picture a city where your daily commute offers views of fjords, drifting ice and the Northern Lights.

Estonia is one of Europe's best places to spot Eurasian otters, thanks to its clean rivers, wide wetlands and snack-filled coastline. This protected species was named Estonia's Animal of the Year in 2024. While globally considered near threatened, their population here has grown substantially, reaching an estimated 2,000 in recent years, up from a historic low of just 300 before the turn of the millennium.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.SnowOtters_EN-CA1225711176_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.SnowOtters_EN-CA1225711176_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Otter-ly Estonia","Title":"Eurasian otter and pup, Estonia","Copyright":"© Sven Zacek/naturepl.com","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/58.752377,25.331907/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-CA&od=2&shading=flat&pp=58.752377,25.331907;S9;Estonia&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=Estonia&vdpid=70&mb=59.938343~20.331159~57.509323~29.261465&cardbg=%23F98745&dt=1764343800000&tt=Estonia&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DEstonia%2526vdpid%253D70%2526mb%253D59.938343~20.331159~57.509323~29.261465%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745%2526dt%253D1764343800000&tstt0=Estonia&cp=53.211717~6.354397&lvl=4.0126686&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260112_SnowOtters\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Eurasian+otter&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260112_0500\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260112_SnowOtters"},"Ssd":"20260112","Name":"SnowOtters","Market":"EN-CA","Hash":"1225711176","FullDateString":"Jan. 12, 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"On January 11, 1944, Morocco took a bold step toward freedom. Sixty-six leaders signed the Proclamation of Independence, demanding an end to French and Spanish colonial rule and affirming the country's right to sovereignty. This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.BlueMorocco_EN-CA0359516885_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.BlueMorocco_EN-CA0359516885_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"From resistance to radiance","Title":"Blue walls of Chefchaouen, Morocco","Copyright":"© AnetteAndersen/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/35.17139,-5.269722/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-CA&od=2&shading=flat&pp=35.17139,-5.269722;S9;Chefchaouen, Morocco&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=Chefchaouen%2C%20Morocco&satid=id.sid%3A72a1c45b-dfd2-2936-5e1a-172b00e8840c&vdpid=5673699920675078145&mb=35.196239~-5.334048~35.147537~-5.227178&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Chefchaouen%2C%20Tanger-Tetouan-Al%20Hoceima%2C%20Morocco&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DChefchaouen%25252C%252520Morocco%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253A72a1c45b-dfd2-2936-5e1a-172b00e8840c%2526vdpid%253D5673699920675078145%2526mb%253D35.196239~-5.334048~35.147537~-5.227178%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Chefchaouen%2C%20Tanger-Tetouan-Al%20Hoceima%2C%20Morocco&cp=32.477032~-5.071569&lvl=4.95&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260111_BlueMorocco\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Chefchaouen+Morocco&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260111_0500\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260111_BlueMorocco"},"Ssd":"20260111","Name":"BlueMorocco","Market":"EN-CA","Hash":"0359516885","FullDateString":"Jan. 11, 2026"}],"LocStrings":{"LOC_HOMEPAGE_VERTICAL_SCROLL_IOTD":"Image of the day","LOC_HOMEPAGE_VERTICAL_SCROLL_IOTD_LEARN_MORE":"Learn more","LOC_HOMEPAGE_VERTICAL_SCROLL_DONATE_NOW":"Donate now","LOC_HOMEPAGE_VERTICAL_SCROLL_FACT":"Quick fact:","LOC_HOMEPAGE_GALLERY_CARD_TITLE":"Recent Homepage images","LOC_HOMEPAGE_VERTICAL_SCROLL_GALLERY_IMAGE_ARIALABEL":"Homepage image for {0}","LOC_HOMEPAGE_ON_THIS_DAY_TITLE":"On this day in history","LOC_HOMEPAGE_ON_THIS_DAY_IMAGE_ARIALABEL":"On this day in {0}, {1}","LOC_HOMEPAGE_SHARE_TOOLTIP":"Share today's Bing homepage","LOC_HOMEPAGE_WALLPAPERDOWNLOAD_TOOLTIP":"Download this image.
