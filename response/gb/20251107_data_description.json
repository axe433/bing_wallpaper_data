Polar Bear Week is here, and it's more than a date on the calendar. The town of Churchill takes centre stage. Each autumn, hundreds of polar bears gather near here, waiting for the bay to freeze so they can hunt seals again—their primary food source. Ever wondered how they stay warm? A thick layer of fat and a dense undercoat trap heat. Their tangle-resistant hairs shake dry after swimming, and natural oils stop the coat from freezing. Sadly, warmer temperatures delay that freeze, forcing the bears to fast for longer. To cope with the delay, they rest, conserve energy and sometimes wander the area. Scientists track their movements to learn how migration patterns shift each year. Polar Bear Week celebrates these mammals while reminding us that their future depends on what we do about a warming planet.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.WillowBear_EN-GB7735486202_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.WillowBear_EN-GB7735486202_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Bear-ly blending in","Title":"Polar bear in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada","Copyright":"© karen crewe/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/58.7692,-94.1692/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-GB&od=2&shading=flat&pp=58.7692,-94.1692;S9;Churchill, Manitoba, Canada&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=churchill%20manitoba&satid=id.sid%3Ae6c9f8aa-cb7b-f745-3f26-f4382c639a55&vdpid=4880922566442614785&mb=58.78957~-94.268881~58.701363~-93.959306&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Churchill%2C%20Manitoba%2C%20Canada&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253Dchurchill%252520manitoba%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253Ae6c9f8aa-cb7b-f745-3f26-f4382c639a55%2526vdpid%253D4880922566442614785%2526mb%253D58.78957~-94.268881~58.701363~-93.959306%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Churchill%2C%20Manitoba%2C%20Canada&cp=54.283689~-106.539776&lvl=4.8882194&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251107_WillowBear\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Polar+bear+animal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251107_0000\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251107_WillowBear"},"Ssd":"20251107","Name":"WillowBear","Market":"EN-GB","Hash":"7735486202","FullDateString":"7 Nov 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"What would you wish for if a single lantern could carry it skyward?

They cruise at around 5 miles per hour—great for relaxing, not so great when speedboats come charging through. That's why 'no-wake zones,' or sections of waterways with a strict speed limit, are there to keep manatees safe.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.ManateeBaby_EN-GB2783659253_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.ManateeBaby_EN-GB2783659253_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"A slow reminder for a fast world","Title":"Mother manatee and calf, Crystal River, Florida, United States","Copyright":"© Gregory Sweeney/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/28.90055,-82.59361/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-GB&od=2&shading=flat&pp=28.90055,-82.59361;S9;Crystal River, Florida, United States&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=crystal%20river%20florida&satid=id.sid%3A806df007-cc2a-7eb5-885a-275af60e0442&vdpid=5498223398729285633&mb=28.925877~-82.687263~28.854931~-82.535317&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Crystal%20River%2C%20Florida%2C%20United%20States&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253Dcrystal%252520river%252520florida%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253A806df007-cc2a-7eb5-885a-275af60e0442%2526vdpid%253D5498223398729285633%2526mb%253D28.925877~-82.687263~28.854931~-82.535317%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Crystal%20River%2C%20Florida%2C%20United%20States&cp=24.99799~-97.998574&lvl=5.48411&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251114_ManateeBaby\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Manatee&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251114_0000\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251114_ManateeBaby"},"Ssd":"20251114","Name":"ManateeBaby","Market":"EN-GB","Hash":"2783659253","FullDateString":"14 Nov 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Of all the plants on Earth, the quiver tree looks the most like a vision from the future.

Instead, the Colosseum was a fully free-standing architectural giant. Crafted from stone and concrete, its arches and vaults supported an arena that could host up to 50,000 spectators.
