Also known as caribou, they are the spirit animals of Christmas lovers—and they rock it. Sturdy and sure-footed, they've been pulling Santa's sleigh ever since Clement Clarke Moore cast them in the role in his 1823 poem 'A Visit from Saint Nicholas.' And they were born for it. Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction. Still not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock. Instead, their melatonin—the hormone that regulates sleep—adjusts to light and darkness, helping them stay awake through endless nights of gift delivery. They carry Santa through the air, excel on land and move effortlessly through icy waters, thanks to their strong swimming skills.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-GB1843825252_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-GB1843825252_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Where holiday magic runs on hooves","Title":"Reindeer during winter snowfall, Lapland, Finland","Copyright":"© Roberto Moiola/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"","Link":""},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"Reindeer can live up to 15 years in the wild, while those cared for by humans may reach as much as 20 years.","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251223_ReindeerFinland\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Reindeer&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251223_0000\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251223_ReindeerFinland"},"Ssd":"20251223","Name":"ReindeerFinland","Market":"EN-GB","Hash":"1843825252","FullDateString":"23 Dec 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"As Christmas approaches, each sunset gives way to a glow of festive lights, bringing a touch of wonder and preparing us for the holiday season.
