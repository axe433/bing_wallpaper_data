Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 71 metres tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 28 metres wide, its ears measure nearly 7 metres long and each foot extends 8.5 metres. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.LeshanBuddha_EN-GB3999315510_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.LeshanBuddha_EN-GB3999315510_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"The guardian of the waters","Title":"Leshan Giant Buddha, Sichuan, China","Copyright":"© www.anotherdayattheoffice.org/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/29.5441,103.771278/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-GB&od=2&shading=flat&pp=29.5441,103.771278;S9;Leshan Giant Buddha, Sichuan, China&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=leshan%20giant%20buddha&ss=ypid.YN4067x6797637560291908474&mb=29.548017~103.764195~29.540177~103.778358&description=No.2435%20Lingyun%20Street%2C%20Shizhong%20District%2C%20Leshan%20614000&cardbg=%23219AB6&dt=1759840200000&tt=Giant%20Buddha%20of%20Leshan&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253Dleshan%252520giant%252520buddha%2526ss%253Dypid.YN4067x6797637560291908474%2526mb%253D29.548017~103.764195~29.540177~103.778358%2526description%253DNo.2435%252520Lingyun%252520Street%25252C%252520Shizhong%252520District%25252C%252520Leshan%252520614000%2526cardbg%253D%252523219AB6%2526dt%253D1759840200000&tstt0=Giant%20Buddha%20of%20Leshan&cp=30.085926~72.611629&lvl=3.6280696&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251122_LeshanBuddha\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Leshan+Giant+Buddha&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251122_0000\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251122_LeshanBuddha"},"Ssd":"20251122","Name":"LeshanBuddha","Market":"EN-GB","Hash":"3999315510","FullDateString":"22 Nov 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"This harbour seal, photographed at Robert Moses State Park on Long Island, New York, seems to be onto something—spreading good vibes, one wave at a time.

They brought it to life by placing artwork within the landscape, like 'Three Upright Motives' by English sculptor Henry Moore in the Pampelse Zand and the President Steyn stone bench by Belgian architect Henry van de Velde, among others.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.DeerVeluwe_EN-GB4885545035_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.DeerVeluwe_EN-GB4885545035_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Oh deer, it's cold!","Title":"Red deer stag in De Hoge Veluwe National Park, Netherlands","Copyright":"© CreativeNature_nl/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/52.102749,5.787268/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-GB&od=2&shading=flat&pp=52.102749,5.787268;S9;De Hoge Veluwe National Park, Gelderland, Netherlands&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=De%20Hoge%20Veluwe%20National%20Park&ss=ypid.YN8000x15656035176455008411&mb=52.107092~5.779538~52.098406~5.794988&description=6731%20Ede&cardbg=%233DB838&dt=1760682600000&tt=De%20Hoge%20Veluwe%20National%20Park&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253DDe%252520Hoge%252520Veluwe%252520National%252520Park%2526ss%253Dypid.YN8000x15656035176455008411%2526mb%253D52.107092~5.779538~52.098406~5.794988%2526description%253D6731%252520Ede%2526cardbg%253D%2525233DB838%2526dt%253D1760682600000&tstt0=De%20Hoge%20Veluwe%20National%20Park&cp=43.412751~-9.325404&lvl=4.2659554&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251129_DeerVeluwe\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=De+Hoge+Veluwe+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251129_0000\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251129_DeerVeluwe"},"Ssd":"20251129","Name":"DeerVeluwe","Market":"EN-GB","Hash":"4885545035","FullDateString":"29 Nov 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Some valleys ask to be explored; Val Brandet in Lombardy, Italy, invites you to slow down and listen.
