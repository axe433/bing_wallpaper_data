They stand out for their social life and their ability to adapt to the harshest winters. They live in colonies that cooperate with each other and use sharp whistles to warn of predators. Their bodies are robust, and they have thick coats of fur that protect them from extreme cold. During winter, they hibernate for several months thanks to a remarkable drop in body temperature. They dig extensive underground tunnels where they take shelter and raise their young. In today's image, we see alpine marmots in Hohe Tauern National Park in Austria, a landscape where this animal has become a symbol of high mountain life. Observing them in the wild allows us to admire their social behaviour and survival skills, connecting visitors with nature in its most authentic state.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.AlpineMarmots_ROW2437915597_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.AlpineMarmots_ROW2437915597_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Info","Title":"Alpine marmots, Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria","Copyright":"© Raimund Linke/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"","Link":""},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260202_AlpineMarmots\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Alpine+marmots&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260202_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260202_AlpineMarmots"},"Ssd":"20260202","Name":"AlpineMarmots","Market":"ROW","Hash":"2437915597","FullDateString":"Feb 2, 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Colour feels at home in Olinda.

Once the water settles in, the sun's heat does the rest, slowly evaporating it into natural Mediterranean salt. Gozo became a salt-making hub because its limestone coast is easy to shape, and its warm, dry summers keep the crystallisation process steady. The first crystals form around May, marking the beginning of the harvesting season.
