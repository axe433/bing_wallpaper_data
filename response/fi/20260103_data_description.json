The town of Lauterbrunnen, with its 72 waterfalls, is often considered one of the most picturesque valleys in the world. This is the landscape a young traveller, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.LauterbrunnenValley_ROW1355118346_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.LauterbrunnenValley_ROW1355118346_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Info","Title":"Staubbach Falls at Lauterbrunnen, Canton of Bern, Switzerland","Copyright":"© pongnathee kluaythong/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"","Link":""},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260103_LauterbrunnenValley\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Staubbach+Falls&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260103_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260103_LauterbrunnenValley"},"Ssd":"20260103","Name":"LauterbrunnenValley","Market":"ROW","Hash":"1355118346","FullDateString":"3. tammik. 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Seeing Venice from above is mesmerising, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways.
