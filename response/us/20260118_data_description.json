A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centerpiece is haggis, a savory pudding made from minced meat, oats, and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse, and a dram of whisky, and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Even if you're celebrating stateside, these traditions are easy to adopt—set the table, cue the poetry, and let the toasts flow.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.BurnsPark_EN-US9363066918_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.BurnsPark_EN-US9363066918_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Tradition burns bright","Title":"Burns National Heritage Park, Ayr, Ayrshire, Scotland","Copyright":"© Alister Firth/Alamy","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/55.427528,-4.634584/6?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-US&od=2&shading=flat&pp=55.427528,-4.634584;S9;Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, Ayr, Scotland&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=Robert%20Burns%20Birthplace%20Museum%20%28National%20Trust%20for%20Scotland%29%20burns%20national%20heritage%20park&ss=ypid.YN46FFCCC973A6CD64&mb=58.289627~-11.093597~52.33616~1.835139&description=Murdoch%27s%20Lone%20Alloway%2C%20Ayr%20KA7%204PQ&dt=1765533600000&tt=Robert%20Burns%20Birthplace%20Museum%20%28National%20Trust%20for%20Scotland%29&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253DRobert%252520Burns%252520Birthplace%252520Museum%252520%252528National%252520Trust%252520for%252520Scotland%252529%252520burns%252520national%252520heritage%252520park%2526ss%253Dypid.YN46FFCCC973A6CD64%2526mb%253D58.289627~-11.093597~52.33616~1.835139%2526description%253DMurdoch%252527s%252520Lone%252520Alloway%25252C%252520Ayr%252520KA7%2525204PQ%2526dt%253D1765533600000&tstt0=Robert%20Burns%20Birthplace%20Museum%20%28National%20Trust%20for%20Scotland%29&cp=55.424904~-11.625024&lvl=6.47&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260125_BurnsPark\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Burns+night+Robert+Burns&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260125_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260125_BurnsPark"},"Ssd":"20260125","Name":"BurnsPark","Market":"EN-US","Hash":"9363066918","FullDateString":"Jan 25, 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Nestled in the Urseren Valley at about 4,715 feet, Andermatt is a charming Swiss village embraced by the majestic Alps.
