Welcome to Muir Woods National Monument—established on this day in 1908—a majestic hall of coastal redwoods just north of San Francisco. These towering redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth—one here stretches about 258 feet, roughly the height of 43 people stacked head to toe. Most are 600–800 years old, and some have stood for over a millennium, yet they're still considered 'young' for a species that can live for 2,000 years.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.MuirWoodsMonument_EN-US9831416144_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.MuirWoodsMonument_EN-US9831416144_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Where time grows tall","Title":"Giant redwood trees in Muir Woods National Monument, California","Copyright":"© photo by canderson/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/37.897026,-122.581123/6?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-US&od=2&shading=flat&pp=37.897026,-122.581123;S9;Muir Woods National Monument, California&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=Muir%20Woods%20National%20Monument%2C%20Marin%20County%2C%20California%2C%20United%20States&ss=ypid.YN31836A49F9DC3B3&mb=37.902685~-122.58884~37.891357~-122.57339&description=Mill%20Valley%2C%20CA%2094941&cardbg=%233DB838&dt=1764082800000&tt=Muir%20Woods%20National%20Monument&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253DMuir%252520Woods%252520National%252520Monument%25252C%252520Marin%252520County%25252C%252520California%25252C%252520United%252520States%2526ss%253Dypid.YN31836A49F9DC3B3%2526mb%253D37.902685~-122.58884~37.891357~-122.57339%2526description%253DMill%252520Valley%25252C%252520CA%25252094941%2526cardbg%253D%2525233DB838%2526dt%253D1764082800000&tstt0=Muir%20Woods%20National%20Monument&cp=37.579413~-126.782227&lvl=6&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260109_MuirWoodsMonument\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Muir+Woods+National+Monument&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260109_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260109_MuirWoodsMonument"},"Ssd":"20260109","Name":"MuirWoodsMonument","Market":"EN-US","Hash":"9831416144","FullDateString":"Jan 9, 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"When a bird is called a starling, you'd expect it to be a bit of a show-off.

From shimmering feathers that glint green and purple in the sun, to its ability to mimic sounds, the starling is the headline act. Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe. In the 19th century, a group of them were introduced to New York's Central Park by an enthusiast of birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.StarlingBrighton2025_EN-US6998438769_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.StarlingBrighton2025_EN-US6998438769_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Rust meets rush","Title":"Starling murmuration over the ruins of Brighton's West Pier, England","Copyright":"© Philip Reeve/Photodisc/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/50.822063,-0.152842/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-US&od=2&shading=flat&pp=50.822063,-0.152842;S9;West Pier, Brighton, England&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=West%20Pier%20Brighton&ss=ypid.YN1029x11401044389788024509&mb=50.826535~-0.160568~50.817602~-0.145118&description=West%20Pier%20Kings%20Road%2C%20West%20Blatchington%20BN1%202FL&cardbg=%23219AB6&dt=1757691000000&tt=West%20Pier&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253DWest%252520Pier%252520Brighton%2526ss%253Dypid.YN1029x11401044389788024509%2526mb%253D50.826535~-0.160568~50.817602~-0.145118%2526description%253DWest%252520Pier%252520Kings%252520Road%25252C%252520West%252520Blatchington%252520BN1%2525202FL%2526cardbg%253D%252523219AB6%2526dt%253D1757691000000&tstt0=West%20Pier&cp=53.102534~-16.017452&lvl=5.3137417&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260108_StarlingBrighton2025\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Starlings&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260108_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260108_StarlingBrighton2025"},"Ssd":"20260108","Name":"StarlingBrighton2025","Market":"EN-US","Hash":"6998438769","FullDateString":"Jan 8, 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Today is a day that puts time into perspective. Old Rock Day highlights the vast geological processes that have shaped our world since its earliest eras. In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.OldRockArch_EN-US2422589534_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.OldRockArch_EN-US2422589534_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Rock legends","Title":"Turret Arch framed by North Window in Arches National Park, Utah","Copyright":"© Jim Patterson/TANDEM Stills + Motion","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/39.319587,-109.759965/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-US&od=2&shading=flat&pp=39.319587,-109.759965;S9;Turret Arch, Arches National Park, Utah&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=Turret%20Arch%2C%20Moab%2C%20UT%2C%20United%20States&ss=ypid.YNFC28AB40F6C87C7E&mb=38.68762~-109.542017~38.680987~-109.527855&description=Moab%2C%20UT%2084532&cardbg=%23219AB6&dt=1763123400000&tt=Turret%20Arch&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253DTurret%252520Arch%25252C%252520Moab%25252C%252520UT%25252C%252520United%252520States%2526ss%253Dypid.YNFC28AB40F6C87C7E%2526mb%253D38.68762~-109.542017~38.680987~-109.527855%2526description%253DMoab%25252C%252520UT%25252084532%2526cardbg%253D%252523219AB6%2526dt%253D1763123400000&tstt0=Turret%20Arch&cp=38.431156~-117.651931&lvl=5.3719306&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260107_OldRockArch\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Arches+National+Park+Windows&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260107_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260107_OldRockArch"},"Ssd":"20260107","Name":"OldRockArch","Market":"EN-US","Hash":"2422589534","FullDateString":"Jan 7, 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Picture a city where your daily commute offers views of fjords, drifting ice, and the Northern Lights.
