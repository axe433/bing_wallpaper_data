The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods, or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.LyonTraboules_EN-US9432784340_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.LyonTraboules_EN-US9432784340_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Passages with a past","Title":"A traboule in Lyon, France","Copyright":"© TPopova/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/45.75889,4.841389/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-US&od=2&shading=flat&pp=45.75889,4.841389;S9;Lyon&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=Lyon%20France&satid=id.sid%3Af152adba-40b2-9268-e39b-1c4e4e7e4666&vdpid=7014249592032067585&mb=46.085548~3.903153~45.392784~5.764486&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Lyon%2C%20Auvergne-Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes%2C%20France&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DLyon%252520France%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253Af152adba-40b2-9268-e39b-1c4e4e7e4666%2526vdpid%253D7014249592032067585%2526mb%253D46.085548~3.903153~45.392784~5.764486%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Lyon%2C%20Auvergne-Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes%2C%20France&cp=44.455146~0.14492&lvl=5.126511&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251116_LyonTraboules\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Traboules+of+Lyon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251116_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251116_LyonTraboules"},"Ssd":"20251116","Name":"LyonTraboules","Market":"EN-US","Hash":"9432784340","FullDateString":"Nov 16, 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"If you think the alphabet is straightforward, Japan's Irohazaka Road in Nikko will twist that belief right out of you.

He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 233 feet tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 92 feet wide, its ears measure nearly 23 feet long, and each foot extends over 28 feet.
