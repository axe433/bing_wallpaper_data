You can't help but pause and look closer, right? Centuries back, families began carving these limestone pans, shaping hundreds of basins that trap seawater with each wave. Once the water settles in, the sun's heat does the rest, slowly evaporating it into natural Mediterranean salt. Gozo became a salt-making hub because its limestone coast is easy to shape, and its warm, dry summers keep the crystallisation process steady. The first crystals form around May, marking the beginning of the harvesting season. Workers rake the salt by hand, sweep it with brooms and brushes, gather it into small piles to dry for another day, then bag it and store it in the caves.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.MaltaSalt_ROW3900508445_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.MaltaSalt_ROW3900508445_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Info","Title":"Salt evaporation ponds on the island of Gozo, Malta","Copyright":"© Marius Roman/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"","Link":""},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260205_MaltaSalt\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Gozo+Malta&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260205_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260205_MaltaSalt"},"Ssd":"20260205","Name":"MaltaSalt","Market":"ROW","Hash":"3900508445","FullDateString":"5 fev. 2026"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Red kites are striking birds of prey known for their reddish‑brown bodies, pale heads and long, forked tails that help them steer with impressive precision.
