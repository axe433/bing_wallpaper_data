The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.LyonTraboules_EN-IN1252380209_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.LyonTraboules_EN-IN1252380209_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Passages with a past","Title":"A traboule in Lyon, France","Copyright":"© TPopova/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/45.75889,4.841389/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=45.75889,4.841389;S9;Lyon, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=Lyon%20France&satid=id.sid%3Af152adba-40b2-9268-e39b-1c4e4e7e4666&vdpid=7014249592032067585&mb=46.085548~3.903153~45.392784~5.764486&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Lyon%2C%20Auvergne-Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes%2C%20France&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DLyon%252520France%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253Af152adba-40b2-9268-e39b-1c4e4e7e4666%2526vdpid%253D7014249592032067585%2526mb%253D46.085548~3.903153~45.392784~5.764486%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Lyon%2C%20Auvergne-Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes%2C%20France&cp=44.455146~0.14492&lvl=5.126511&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251116_LyonTraboules\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Traboules+of+Lyon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251115_1830\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251116_LyonTraboules"},"Ssd":"20251116","Name":"LyonTraboules","Market":"EN-IN","Hash":"1252380209","FullDateString":"16 Nov, 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"If you think the alphabet is straightforward, Japan's Irohazaka Road in Nikko will twist that belief right out of you.

Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At approximately 70 metres tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 28 metres wide, its ears measure nearly 7 metres long and each foot extends over 8 metres. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.LeshanBuddha_EN-IN4570955988_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.LeshanBuddha_EN-IN4570955988_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"The guardian of the waters","Title":"Leshan Giant Buddha, Sichuan, China","Copyright":"© www.anotherdayattheoffice.org/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/29.5441,103.771278/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=29.5441,103.771278;S9;Leshan Giant Buddha, Sichuan, China&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=18&q=leshan%20giant%20buddha&ss=ypid.YN4067x6797637560291908474&mb=29.548017~103.764195~29.540177~103.778358&description=No.2435%20Lingyun%20Street%2C%20Shizhong%20District%2C%20Leshan%20614000&cardbg=%23219AB6&dt=1759840200000&tt=Giant%20Buddha%20of%20Leshan&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253Dleshan%252520giant%252520buddha%2526ss%253Dypid.YN4067x6797637560291908474%2526mb%253D29.548017~103.764195~29.540177~103.778358%2526description%253DNo.2435%252520Lingyun%252520Street%25252C%252520Shizhong%252520District%25252C%252520Leshan%252520614000%2526cardbg%253D%252523219AB6%2526dt%253D1759840200000&tstt0=Giant%20Buddha%20of%20Leshan&cp=30.085926~72.611629&lvl=3.6280696&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251122_LeshanBuddha\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Leshan+Giant+Buddha&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251121_1830\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251122_LeshanBuddha"},"Ssd":"20251122","Name":"LeshanBuddha","Market":"EN-IN","Hash":"4570955988","FullDateString":"22 Nov, 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"In Ezhikkara, water decides how life unfolds.
