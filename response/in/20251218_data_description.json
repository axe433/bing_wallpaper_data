Today, Christmas—a Christian celebration of faith, light and togetherness—invites us to welcome warmth and joy into the coldest days of the year. Across continents, candles glow on windowsills and garlands twine through homes and streets. Evergreen trees stand adorned, their branches heavy with ornaments and gifts waiting quietly beneath.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.SantaGlobe_EN-IN8671777119_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.SantaGlobe_EN-IN8671777119_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Miniature worlds, infinite wonder","Title":"Snow globes at a Christmas market in Heidelberg, Germany","Copyright":"© George Pachantouris/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/49.402892,8.679985/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=49.402892,8.679985;S9;Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=Heidelberg%2C%20Germany&satid=id.sid%3A0ed4c4ac-d0e9-d557-45fe-d5248ba0c523&vdpid=7015010726708248577&mb=49.459599~8.549026~49.35215~8.818228&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Heidelberg%2C%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg%2C%20Germany&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DHeidelberg%25252C%252520Germany%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253A0ed4c4ac-d0e9-d557-45fe-d5248ba0c523%2526vdpid%253D7015010726708248577%2526mb%253D49.459599~8.549026~49.35215~8.818228%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Heidelberg%2C%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg%2C%20Germany&cp=49.401353~-2.288079&lvl=4.99&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251225_SantaGlobe\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Christmas&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251224_1830\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251225_SantaGlobe"},"Ssd":"20251225","Name":"SantaGlobe","Market":"EN-IN","Hash":"8671777119","FullDateString":"25 Dec, 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"As Christmas Eve arrives, millions embrace customs that connect us to our roots—or introduce us to entirely new cultures.

Also known as caribou, they are the spirit animals of Christmas lovers—and they rock it. Sturdy and sure-footed, they've been pulling Santa's sleigh ever since Clement Clarke Moore cast them in the role in his 1823 poem 'A Visit from Saint Nicholas.' And they were born for it. Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction. Still not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock. Instead, their melatonin—the hormone that regulates sleep—adjusts to light and darkness, helping them stay awake through endless nights of gift delivery.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-IN8311415017_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-IN8311415017_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Where holiday magic runs on hooves","Title":"Reindeer during winter snowfall, Lapland, Finland","Copyright":"© Roberto Moiola/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"","Link":""},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"Reindeer can live up to 15 years in the wild, while those cared for by humans may reach as much as 20 years.","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251223_ReindeerFinland\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Reindeer&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251222_1830\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251223_ReindeerFinland"},"Ssd":"20251223","Name":"ReindeerFinland","Market":"EN-IN","Hash":"8311415017","FullDateString":"23 Dec, 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"As Christmas approaches, each sunset gives way to a glow of festive lights, bringing a touch of wonder and preparing us for the holiday season.

The story unfolds on Christmas Eve, in the midst of holiday cheer, when Clara receives a nutcracker as a gift. As night falls and the household drifts into sleep, the little girl and her nutcracker embark on a fantastical journey—battling the Mouse King and wandering through the Land of Sweets. Among its most famous moments is the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy—the ruler of the Land of Sweets—accompanied by music that has become iconic. Tchaikovsky composed these enchanting melodies for the celesta, an instrument often called the bell-piano.

The first of these stars emerged in Niesky, Germany, in the early 1800s. Students at a Moravian Church boarding school crafted what we now call the Herrnhut Star or Moravian Star, during a geometry lesson. That geometric marvel, crafted from paper and cardboard, soon came to symbolise the Star of Bethlehem and the spirit of Advent. By 1897, Pieter Verbeek, a former student of that school, began producing and selling them.
