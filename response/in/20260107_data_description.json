Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fuelling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art and landmarks such as St Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Rialto Bridge.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.VeniceView_EN-IN1223901248_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.VeniceView_EN-IN1223901248_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"The soul of Venice","Title":"Aerial view of Venice, Italy","Copyright":"© Clement Leonard/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/45.4397,12.3319/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=45.4397,12.3319;S9;Venice, Italy&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=Venice%2C%20Italy&satid=id.sid%3A558e4220-5944-57d7-3d5c-ee9c55739f9d&vdpid=9867990&mb=45.444739~12.318892~45.434667~12.344899&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=metropolitan%20city%20of%20venice&tsts1=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DVenice%25252C%252520Italy%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253A558e4220-5944-57d7-3d5c-ee9c55739f9d%2526vdpid%253D9867990%2526mb%253D45.444739~12.318892~45.434667~12.344899%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt1=metropolitan%20city%20of%20venice&cp=45.429299~7.03125&lvl=6&pi=0&ftst=1&ftics=True&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20260102_VeniceView\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Venice+Italy&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20260101_1830\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20260102_VeniceView"},"Ssd":"20260102","Name":"VeniceView","Market":"EN-IN","Hash":"1223901248","FullDateString":"2 Jan, 2026"}],"PreloadMediaContents":[{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Tucked deep within Norway's Arctic Circle, Reine feels like the kind of place you see on a postcard and assume can't possibly be real.
