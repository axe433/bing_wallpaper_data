He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At approximately 70 metres tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 28 metres wide, its ears measure nearly 7 metres long and each foot extends over 8 metres.

Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes. This is where townsfolk gather to celebrate winter and catch up on the news while sipping mulled wine. These markets have always symbolised more than shopping—they offer an escape from the everyday routine.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.LeipzigMarket_EN-IN0234720576_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.LeipzigMarket_EN-IN0234720576_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Twinkle all the way","Title":"Christmas market in Leipzig, Germany","Copyright":"© Krzysztof Baranowski/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"//platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/51.34063,12.37473/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=51.34063,12.37473;S9;Leipzig, Germany&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro","Link":"/maps?ty=30&q=Leipzig&satid=id.sid%3Aff50f94c-10e8-9487-0ea8-49b8334c589c&vdpid=7018132236914393089&mb=51.448078~12.083753~51.238144~12.695736&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Leipzig%2C%20Saxony%2C%20Germany&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DLeipzig%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253Aff50f94c-10e8-9487-0ea8-49b8334c589c%2526vdpid%253D7018132236914393089%2526mb%253D51.448078~12.083753~51.238144~12.695736%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Leipzig%2C%20Saxony%2C%20Germany&cp=39.509133~-17.702983&lvl=3.568267&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=hpbal1"},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251130_LeipzigMarket\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Leipzig&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251129_1830\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251130_LeipzigMarket"},"Ssd":"20251130","Name":"LeipzigMarket","Market":"EN-IN","Hash":"0234720576","FullDateString":"30 Nov, 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"Picture 54 square kilometres of open land, wildlife on the move, and a stag flaunting its crown of antlers.
