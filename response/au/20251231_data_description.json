Spanning the River Spree between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, it connects two districts while juggling trains on top, traffic below and crowds of sunset hunters in between. Originally a wooden crossing, the bridge took on its signature red-brick Gothic revival form in 1896, complete with turreted towers that look like they wandered in from a medieval set. But the real twist came during the Cold War, when the bridge became a strict checkpoint between East and West. After reunification, it was restored in the 1990s and welcomed the U1 line back across its upper deck.","Image":{"Url":"/th?id=OHR.GermanyNewYear_ROW1011878383_1920x1080.webp","Wallpaper":"/th?id=OHR.GermanyNewYear_ROW1011878383_1920x1200.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1200.jpg","Downloadable":true},"Headline":"Info","Title":"Oberbaum Bridge, Berlin, Germany","Copyright":"© spreephoto.de/Getty Images","SocialGood":null,"MapLink":{"Url":"","Link":""},"QuickFact":{"MainText":"","LinkUrl":"","LinkText":""},"TriviaUrl":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20251231_GermanyNewYear\"&FORM=HPQUIZ","BackstageUrl":"/search?q=Oberbaum+Bridge&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:\"20251231_0800\"+mgzv3configlist:\"BingQA_Encyclopedia_Layout\"","TriviaId":"HPQuiz_20251231_GermanyNewYear"},"Ssd":"20251231","Name":"GermanyNewYear","Market":"ROW","Hash":"1011878383","FullDateString":"31 Dec 2025"},{"ImageContent":{"Description":"In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that sweeps across the water.
